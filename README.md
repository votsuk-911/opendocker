### FAQ

#### How is this different from lazydocker?

- Built with a modern TypeScript + Solid.js stack using the [@opentui](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui) framework
- 60 FPS rendering for a smooth terminal experience
- Clean, minimal interface focused on the essentials
- Active development with native cross-platform binaries

#### Does this work with Docker Desktop?

Yes. OpenDocker works with Docker Desktop, OrbStack, and any Docker-compatible runtime. It connects to the Docker socket to stream data, so as long as your Docker daemon is running, you're good to go.

#### Can it modify my containers?

Not yet. OpenDocker is currently read-only — you can view containers, stream logs, and browse images and volumes, but you can't start, stop, or remove anything. Full container management is coming soon.

#### Does it work over SSH/tmux?

Yes. OpenDocker supports OSC52 for clipboard operations, so copying text works even in remote SSH sessions and tmux.

#### What are the requirements?

- Docker (or a Docker-compatible runtime) installed and running
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
